I think Ima use the useNavigation() method to navigate through the app bc it's simple

useNavigation() method example:

import * as React from 'react';
import { Button } from 'react-native';
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';

function MyBackButton() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  return (
    <Button
      title="Back"
      onPress={() => {
        navigation.goBack();
      }}
    />
  );
}


also, i think using a drawer instead of a tabbar is better because it's more widely used;
however, I am open to changing it if you guys care.
